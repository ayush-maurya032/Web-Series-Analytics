# Web-Series-Analytics
The web series analysis project
has presented a treasure trove of insights and
tools to augment comprehension and enhance the
performance of web series content. The
combined use of data collection, preprocessing,
and machine learning techniques, particularly the
employment of linear regression and feature
selection, has propelled our understanding of
viewer behavior, engagement dynamics, and the
critical factors driving success. In essence, the
incorporation of linear regression within this web
series analysis project has not only revealed
actionable insights into viewer engagement but
also armed content creators and platform
operators with a predictive tool that empowers
data-informed decision-making.
